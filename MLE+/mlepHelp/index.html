    MLE+ is an open-source Matlab/Simulink toolbox for co-simulation with 
    the whole-building energy simulator EnergyPlus. It is designed for 
    engineers and researchers who are familiar with Matlab and Simulink and 
    want to use these software tools in building energy simulation.

    <LI>The MLE+ front-end streamlines the configuration process of 
    linking the building model and the controllers by ab- stracting the 
    necessary parameters from the co-simulation. This reduces setup time 
    and configuration problems.</LI>
    <LI>MLE+ provides a control development workflow as well as graphical 
    front-ends for designing advanced control strategies, in which the 
    building simulation is carried out by EnergyPlus while the controllers 
    are implemented in Matlab or Simulink.</LI>
    <LI>After a co-simulation run, using MLE+, the output data from 
    EnergyPlus can be aggregated, analyzed and visualized in Matlab.</LI> 
    <LI>MLE+ allows complete access to the Matlab environment and toolboxes 
    such as Global Optimization Toolbox, System Identification Toolbox and 
    Model Predictive Control Toolbox. The user can step through the code 
    for debugging and pause the co-simulation at any time.</LI>
