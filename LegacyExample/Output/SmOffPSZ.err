   ** Warning ** GetSurfaceData: The total number of floors, walls, roofs and internal mass surfaces in Zone BASE-1
   **   ~~~   ** is < 6. This may cause an inaccurate zone heat balance calculation.
   ************* Note that the following warning(s) may/will occur if you have not enclosed your zone completely.
   ** Warning ** Entered Zone Volumes differ from calculated zone volume(s).
   **   ~~~   ** ...use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to show more details on individual zones.
   ** Warning ** CheckUsedConstructions: There are 1 nominally unused constructions in input.
   **   ~~~   ** For explicit details on each unused construction, use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings;
   ** Warning ** Surfaces in Zone="BASE-1" do not define an enclosure.
   **   ~~~   ** Number of surfaces <= 3, view factors are set to force reciprocity.

   ************* ===== Final Error Summary =====
   ************* The following error categories occurred.  Consider correcting or noting.
   ************* Nominally Unused Constructions
   ************* ..The nominally unused constructions warning is provided to alert you to potential conditions that can cause
   ************* ..extra time during simulation. Each construction is calculated by the algorithm indicated in the HeatBalanceAlgorithm
   ************* ..object. You may remove the constructions indicated (when you use the DisplayExtraWarnings option).
