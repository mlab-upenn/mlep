   ** Warning ** CheckIFAnyEMS: No EnergyManagementSystem has been set up in the input file but output is requested.
   **   ~~~   ** No EDD file will be produced. Refer to EMS Application Guide and/or InputOutput Reference to set up your EnergyManagementSystem.
   ** Warning ** Sizing:Parameters: note Timesteps in Averaging Window entered value=[6] is less than 1 hour (i.e., 60 timesteps).
   ** Warning ** ManageSizing: For a zone sizing run, there must be at least 1 Sizing:Zone input object. SimulationControl Zone Sizing option ignored.
   ************* Beginning Plant Sizing Calculations
   ** Warning ** CheckUsedConstructions: There are 13 nominally unused constructions in input.
   **   ~~~   ** For explicit details on each unused construction, use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings;
   ** Warning ** Bad starting values for calculating Reform Chiller IPLV
   **   ~~~   ** Reformulated Chiller IPLV calculation failed for COOLSYS1 CHILLER 1
   ** Warning ** Bad starting values for calculating Reform Chiller IPLV
   **   ~~~   ** Reformulated Chiller IPLV calculation failed for COOLSYS1 CHILLER 2
   ** Warning ** Check input. Calculated Pump Efficiency=43.33% which is less than 50%, for pump=COOLSYS1 PUMP
   **   ~~~   ** Calculated Pump_Efficiency % =Total_Efficiency % [39.0] / Motor_Efficiency % [90.0]
   **   ~~~   ** Total_Efficiency % =(Rated_Volume_Flow_Rate [0.3] * Rated_Pump_Head [300000.0] / Rated_Power_Use [200000.0]) * 100.

   ************* ===== Final Error Summary =====
   ************* The following error categories occurred.  Consider correcting or noting.
   ************* Nominally Unused Constructions
   ************* ..The nominally unused constructions warning is provided to alert you to potential conditions that can cause
   ************* ..extra time during simulation. Each construction is calculated by the algorithm indicated in the HeatBalanceAlgorithm
   ************* ..object. You may remove the constructions indicated (when you use the DisplayExtraWarnings option).
