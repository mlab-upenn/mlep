Campus Simulation project consists of three buildings: two office buildings
and a hospital. Two chillers in parallel supply the chilled water demand to
the campus. To run the simulation make sure you have installed MLE+ version
2. You also have to change the settings for the MLE+ Simulink blocks for 
each of the 4 E+ files: 3 buildings and 1 chiller E+ file. You can follow 
the instructions given on the website.
